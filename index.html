<h4><center> Thanks for visiting Beads by NBJ! </center></h4>

  <p>  I'm Noa Fisher-Jerryman, the founder and CEO of Beads by NBJ. My hand-crafted bracelets are made with a variety of beads types.
    I specifically enjoy the texture of the lava bead! Each bead has so much character...they have their own individual story to tell.
    It is my ultimate goal to provide a creative and comfortable product for everyday wear. As a child, I enjoyed making crafts, specifically bracelets.
    As I got older, I continued to make bracelets, discovering new materials along the way.  This passion has led me to creating an unique bracelet line of my own.</p>
